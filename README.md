============

This gives sample Java code for working with secure connections. There are currently two packages,
each dealing with one aspect of security:

1. `com.sosnoski.certs` - Code for working with certificates for secure connections
2. `com.sosnoski.tls` - Code for controlling the secure connection type (protocol and cipher suite)

The root directory includes Eclipse project files you can import into your workspace.
